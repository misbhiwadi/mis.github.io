Subject: Feedback & Guidelines for Next Session

Before we start the new session, a few important guidelines to avoid repeating earlier mistakes — please follow these going forward:

Maintain context. Don’t lose the conversation context between commands — each command should follow the previous one unless the user explicitly asks to change topic.

Never modify or delete code without permission. Always ask the user before making any changes to their code or removing files.

Don’t use backups without approval. Do not pick or restore code from backups unless the user explicitly requests it.

Only edit the requested page or file. If a user asks you to change something, confirm which file/page they mean before making edits. Re-confirm with the user when in doubt.

Check dependencies and track versions before major changes. For any significant update, review all dependent components and keep versioned backups so you can safely revert accidental changes.

Please follow these rules for every session. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Below are some feedback if required this related changes then you can take help.

CAROUSEL NAVIGATION ISSUE & FIX DOCUMENTATION
==============================================

DATE: 2025-11-02
FILE: aluminium_fabrication.html
CAROUSELS AFFECTED: carousel-facade, carousel-glass-film-new

## ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
- Carousel items were duplicating in main gallery
- Navigation arrows and indicators not working properly
- Multiple CSS styles applying simultaneously causing malfunction
- Same issue previously occurred and was fixed in facade section

## ROOT CAUSE:
Owl Carousel and Bootstrap Carousel conflict:
- Both carousel libraries trying to control same elements
- Owl carousel initialization interfering with Bootstrap carousel functionality
- CSS transitions and transforms causing display issues
- No proper active/inactive item state management

## SOLUTION APPLIED:

### CSS FIX:
```css
#carousel-facade .carousel-inner .item {
    display: block !important;
    position: relative !important;
    transition: none !important;
    transform: none !important;
    animation: none !important;
}

#carousel-facade .carousel-inner .item.active {
    display: block !important;
}

#carousel-facade .carousel-inner .item:not(.active) {
    display: none !important;
}
```

### JAVASCRIPT FIX:
```javascript
// Remove owl carousel conflicts
$('#carousel-facade').removeClass('owl-carousel');

if ($('#carousel-facade').data('owl.carousel')) {
    $('#carousel-facade').data('owl.carousel').destroy();
}

// Setup Bootstrap carousel properly
$('#carousel-facade').carousel('pause');

$('#carousel-facade').carousel({
    interval: false,
    wrap: true,
    pause: false
});

$('#carousel-facade').on('slid.bs.carousel', function () {
    $(this).carousel('pause');
});
```

## PATTERN FOR FUTURE FIXES:
1. Add CSS fix after existing carousel fixes (around line 720)
2. Add JavaScript fix after existing carousel JS (around line 2780)
3. Use same pattern: remove owl carousel, setup Bootstrap carousel
4. Replace carousel ID in both CSS and JS sections

## CAROUSELS FIXED:
- carousel-facade (Facade Exterior) ✅
- carousel-glass-film-new (Glass Film) ✅

## PREVENTION:
- Always check for owl carousel conflicts when adding new carousels
- Use Bootstrap carousel only, avoid mixing with owl carousel
- Apply this same CSS/JS pattern for any new carousel additions
- Test navigation arrows and indicators after adding new carousels

## COMMAND TO REMEMBER:
When adding new carousel with ID "carousel-newname":
1. Add CSS block replacing "carousel-newname" 
2. Add JS block replacing "carousel-newname"
3. Follow exact same pattern as carousel-facade fix

## GLASS FILM DUPLICATION & SCROLL ISSUE
DATE: 2025-11-02

### ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
- Glass Film item appeared TWICE in main carousel
- Original Glass Film had broken scroll behavior (wrong anchor)
- Overlay "View more" link pointing to non-existent section

### ROOT CAUSE:
1. **Duplication**: Two separate Glass Film gallery items existed
   - Original: Lines ~1081 (linked to film.html)
   - Duplicate: Lines 1488-1505 (linked to carousel-glass-film-new)

2. **Broken Scroll**: Original item had mismatched anchor references
   - Overlay link: pointed to 'glass-film-section' (doesn't exist)
   - Title/button links: pointed to 'film.html' (external page)
   - Should point to: 'carousel-glass-film-new' (actual carousel)

### SOLUTION APPLIED:

#### 1. REMOVED DUPLICATE:
```html
<!-- REMOVED: Lines 1488-1505 -->
<!-- Glass Film Product Item -->
<div class="gallery-item">...</div>
```

#### 2. FIXED ORIGINAL ITEM LINKS:
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<a href="film.html">Glass Film</a>
<a href="film.html" class="btn-one">View more</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="...glass-film-section...">View more</a>

<!-- AFTER -->
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="...carousel-glass-film-new...">Glass Film</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="...carousel-glass-film-new..." class="btn-one">View more</a>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="...carousel-glass-film-new...">View more</a>
```

### PREVENTION CHECKLIST:
1. **Before adding new carousel items**: Check if item already exists in main gallery
2. **Consistent anchor naming**: Use same ID for all links (overlay, title, button)
3. **Test scroll behavior**: Verify all "View more" links point to correct carousel section
4. **Remove external links**: Replace file.html links with carousel scroll behavior

### PATTERN FOR FUTURE:
When adding new product carousel:
1. Check main gallery for existing item first
2. If exists: Update links to point to new carousel ID
3. If new: Add single item with consistent carousel anchor links
4. Test all three link types: overlay, title, button
